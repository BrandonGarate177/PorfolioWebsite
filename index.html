                <h1>Passion for Edcation</h1>
                <p>My first time working was at 17 years old. I'm very grateful I was given an opportunity to teach/tutor at Code Ninjas. I quickly discovered that I'm very passionate about teaching. The youth is our future and I find it very important to foster creativity and an Interest in STEM at a young age. A lot of students lack the motivation to learn sciences, and I took this as a challange. A challange to foster their creativity. It's amazing how much a student learns when they are having fun. </p>
                <h1>My Programming Journey</h1>
                <p>Programming became my passion in highschool. While locked inside during covid, I learned that every single piece of technology I was using was actually created with code. I began to teach myself C++, in hindsight that was a bad first language to pick up haha. I also began to create my own discord bots for me and my friends to use. Since then I took many Programming classes in Highschool and enrolled to study Computer Science at San Diego State University. With newly found knowledge I began to expand the variety of my side projects. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="edcuation-section-inside-idek">
                <h1>Research Experience</h1>
                <p>My Data Science and Algorithm's Professor reached out to students asking if anyone was comfortable teaching 3D desgin and Printing. I never in my life touched a 3D printer, but I reached out and offered to help. This quickly became one of the most rewarding experiences of my Career. With the help of another student, I created a curriculm and taught it at an elementary school. Our Professor decided that this would make a great experience report to submit to a scientific conferance. For the duration of a summer a paper was written, and submitted arguing a case about the benefits of such a curriculm in elementary schools and how this creates a passion for technology. Although this paper wasn't accepted into the conferance, it taught me a lot of what was truly possible and how far I can really reach. </p>

        <div class = "passion-project">
            <h1>Current Passion Project</h1>
            <p>One of my closest friends is a Math Tutor. The two of us had a talk about how the current math curriculum often stifles the natural curiosity and excitement for learning mathematics. This conversation was heavily inspired by "A Mathematicians Lament" - Paul Lockhart. Math should be taught with a heavy emphasis on curiosty. We decided that we would create our own paper arguing the importance of curiosity in the K-12 Math Curriculum. We are working towards getting a 4 week after school program where we would teach students with a new approach, with the goal to submit a paper arguing for a revision on the way mathematics should be taught. Math is an art, much like how music is an art. If you were to give students years of homework deciphering sheet music, the passion and curiosty they once help for music would dwindle. </p>
